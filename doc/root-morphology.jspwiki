Multichar_symbols

The morphological analyses of wordforms of Veps are presented
in this system in terms of the following symbols.
(It is highly suggested to follow existing standards when adding new tags).

!!The parts-of-speech are:
 *  +A       = adjective
 *  +Adp     = adposition
 *  +Adv     = adverb

 *  +Po      = postposition
 *  +Pron    = pronoun
 *  +Qnt     = quantifier
 *  +V       = verb

!!Parts of speech are further split up into:

Nouns

 *  +Prop   = proper

!!Pronouns

 *  +Dem    = demonstrative

The Usage extents are marked using the following tags:

 *  +Use/Sub                      =

!ADVERBS
 *  +Manner	 =

Abbreviated words are classified with:

 *  +ABBR +ACR    = 

Special symbols are classified with:

 *  +CLB +PUNCT +LEFT +RIGHT  = 

The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:

 *  +TV +IV   = 

Special multiword units are analysed with:

 *  +Multi  = 

Non-dictionary words can be recognised with:

 *  +Guess   =

Morphophonology
---------------
To represent phonologic variations in word forms we use the following
symbols in the lexicon files:


And following triggers to control variation





We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics:


The word forms in Veps start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes.
